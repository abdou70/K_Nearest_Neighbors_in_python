# K_Nearest_Neighbors_in_python
The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. While it can be used for either regression or classification problems, it is typically used as a classification algorithm, working off the assumption that similar points can be found near one another.

# Determine your distance metrics

it's very important for this task to know how to define the distance wich you want to use it help you to do a better classification
For ecemple:Euclidean distance (p=2): This is the most commonly used distance measure, and it is limited to real-valued vectors. Using the below formula, it measures a straight line between the query point and the other point being measured.
